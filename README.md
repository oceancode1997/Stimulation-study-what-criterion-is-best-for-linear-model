# Simulation study: what criterion is best for linear model selection
Use simulation to find among popular criterion for model selection: AIC, BIC, Radjusted, PRESS, Mallow Cp. what is the best criterion to use when performing linear model selection <br />
Found that BIC outperforms other criterion is various settings. <br />
